    <p class="about-p">
        The
        <i>‘image’</i> is my material and becomes in all its simplicity or complexity the medium. Often I search for the performative
        quality in my work. This I try to achieve by showing the act of manipulation within the image revealing the mechanism
        of the work. After an intuitive creation process, my work reveals itself to me once it is finished. Just like it
        does tell stories to a viewer, also its symbols unveil to me.
