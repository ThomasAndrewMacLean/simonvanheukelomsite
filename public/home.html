        <p class="about-p">
            The
            <i>‘image’</i> is my material and becomes in all its simplicity or complexity the medium. Often I search for the
            performative quality in my work. This I try to achieve by showing the act of manipulation within the image revealing
            the mechanism of the work. After an intuitive creation process, my work reveals itself to me once it is finished.
            Just like it does tell stories to a viewer, also its symbols unveil to me.
